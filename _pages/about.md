Hi. Welcome to my homepage. I'm Tangchao Liu, a graduated master student. During the academic year 2022/2023, I was trained in the Theoretical Physics track of the master second year (M2) program [International Centre for Fundamental Physics (ICFP)](https://www.phys.ens.fr/en/formations/m2-icfp) in Paris, France, led by École Normale Supérieure and jointly organized by several other institutes in the Grand Paris region, including Université Paris-Saclay from which I obtained a first master degree. In 2023/2024 I finished the study in M2 [ High Energy Physics](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/hep/en/programme/programme-lecole-polytechnique/program-m2-ecole-polytechnique-2023-2024) program at École Polytechnique in Palaiseau, France. From October 2024 to August 2025, I was a free mover student at Universität Leipzig and worked as a research assistant in the [Elementary Particle Theory Group](https://www.physik.uni-leipzig.de/index.php?id=tet) in [Institut für Theoretische Physik](https://www.physik.uni-leipzig.de) in Leipzig, Germany. 

I'm mainly interested in classical and semi-classical aspects of General Relativity (GR) and gravitation. Specifically the topics that appeal to me the most include, various theoretical and computational techniques in modelling the waveform of binary systems consisting of compact objects, quantum effects in black hole spacetimes and the early universe, the mathematical structure of geometry and algebra in the study of spacetime. 

This site is constructed to share some of the works done during my research and study of the aforementioned subjects. They can be for both research and pedagogical purposes.
