## Description

The project started when I began my internship at l'Observatoire de Paris, Laboratoire Univers et Théories (LUTH), during March to July in 2024. The internship, worth 30 ECTS among the 60 for the whole academic year, is a requirement to complete the second year of master High Energy Physics at École Polytechnique. The master thesis is defended on July 19th, 2024 in the conference room of Laboratoire Leprince-Ringuet at École Polytechnique.

The project focuses on the first law of mechanics for multipolar particle binary systems, which is a variational formula relating global quantities of the system, such as the ADM energy and angular momentum, to the local quantities, i.e., the individual multipole moments of the constituents. The first law can find its use in waveform modelling, especially for informing the phase of gravitational waves emitted by such a system. It can also serve as a bridge for various theoretical techniques for computing the waveform by informing the calculation of one through the results of the other. It has already been implemented to computing the shift of inner most stable circular orbit of a particle in black hole spacetime caused by the self force, and calibrating the effective one body potential in Hamiltonian formalism etc. 

What is done in this piece of work includes collecting all the prerequisites for deriving the first law at dipolar order in the multipole expansion, as well as some preliminary calculations to extend the formula to quadrupole order. An investigation of extended body in General Relativity (GR) is first carried out, followed by a description of the differential geometry method developed by Iyer and Wald to derive a general variational formula. The latter is further exploited in the specific scenario of the multipolar particle binary system. The first law to dipolar order is finally derived by evaluating the integrals and using techniques from the 3+1 formalism in GR. Strategies for extension to quadrupolar order are stated and the work is currently underway, even though the internship itself is finished.
