## Mathematica codes for the GR Toolkit book

These notebooks are written for my study of the book *A Relativist's Toolkit: The Mathematics of Black Hole Mechanics* by Eric Poisson. For now a few exercises of chapter 2 have been coded, which were written without using xCoba package from xAct. Notebooks for more exercises as well as for reproducing some calculations in the main text of the book are intended. The list will grow, and updates with the use of xAct packages will be included.
