## Mathematica codes for the GR Toolkit book

These notebooks are written for my study of the book *A Relativist's Toolkit: The Mathematics of Black Hole Mechanics* by Eric Poisson. For now a few exercises of chapter 2 have been coded, which were written without using xCoba package from xAct. Notebooks for more exercises as well as for reproducing some calculations in the main text of the book are intended. The list will grow, and updates with the use of xAct packages will be included.

## Free symmetrical top 

This is the example immediately before problem 1 in section 35 in the book Mechanics by Landau and Lifshitz. The method here does not make any assumption for the instantaneous moving (body) frame as in the book, since the heavy algebra can be easily handled with Mathematica. The notations and concepts in the notebook largely follow from my [note on rigid body mechanics via a triad formulation](/files/GRnb/TriadRB.pdf), written when I was thinking of the classical correspondence of a relativistic spinning top in curved spacetime. Although the example here is trivial, it demonstrates the validity of the ideas presented in the notes, which is helpful for understanding spinning particles in curved spacetime by examining its classical counterpart.
