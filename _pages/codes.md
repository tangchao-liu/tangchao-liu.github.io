## Mathematica codes for the GR Toolkit book

These notebooks are written for my study of the book *A Relativist's Toolkit: The Mathematics of Black Hole Mechanics* by Eric Poisson. For now a few exercises have been coded. The use of [xAct](https://josmar493.dreamhosters.com) packages of Mathematica is practiced (especially the [xCoba](https://josmar493.dreamhosters.com/xCoba/index.html) package for component calculations in GR), except for the first two exercises. Notebooks for more exercises as well as for reproducing some calculations in the main text of the book are intended. The list will grow.

- [Chapter 2, exercise 2: Timelike congruence in FLRW and Friedmann equations (no use of xAct)](/files/GRnb/EP_chap2_2.nb)
- [Chapter 2, exercise 3: Timelike congruence in Schwarzschild (no use of xAct)](/files/GRnb/EP_chap2_3.nb)
- [Chapter 5, exercise 4: Kerr geodesics](/files/GRnb/EP_chap5_4.nb)
