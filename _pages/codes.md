## Mathematica notebooks for GR

These notebooks are written for my study of the book *A Relativist's Toolkit: The Mathematics of Black Hole Mechanics* by Eric Poisson. For now a few exercises of chapter 2 have been done by coding. Notebooks for more exercises as well as for reproducing calculations in the main text of the book are also intended. The list will grow.
