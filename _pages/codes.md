## Mathematica codes for the GR Toolkit book

These notebooks are written for my study of the book *A Relativist's Toolkit: The Mathematics of Black Hole Mechanics* by Eric Poisson. For now a few exercises have been coded. The use of [xAct](https://josmar493.dreamhosters.com) packages of Mathematica is practiced (especially the [xCoba](https://josmar493.dreamhosters.com/xCoba/index.html) package for component calculations in GR), except for the first two exercises. Notebooks for more exercises as well as for reproducing some calculations in the main text of the book are intended. The list will grow.

## Free symmetrical top 

This is the example immediately before problem 1 in section 35 in the book Mechanics by Landau and Lifshitz. The method here does not make any assumption for the instantaneous moving (body) frame as in the book, since the heavy algebra can be easily handled with Mathematica. The notations and concepts in the notebook largely follow from my [note on rigid body mechanics via a triad formulation](/files/GRnb/TriadRB.pdf), written when I was thinking of the non-relativistic correspondence of a relativistic spinning top in curved spacetime. Although the example here is trivial, it demonstrates the validity of the ideas presented in the notes, which is helpful for understanding spinning particles in curved spacetime by examining its classical counterpart.
